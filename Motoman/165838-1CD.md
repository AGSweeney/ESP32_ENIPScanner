HW

EtherNet/IP
Communication Function

**1 Introductions**

```
In the DX200 system, the EtherNet/IP communication function (hereinafter
referred to as EtherNet/IP (CPU board)) to which a standard LAN port of
the YPC21 board (CN104 connector) is used can be employed. The
Ethernet communication function of the DX200 provides the following
features: an IO transmission/reception function that enables to exchange
external input/output signals between the DX200 and other EtherNet/IP
supported devices and a message communication function that realizes
data transmission equal to the one realized by the DX200 Ethernet
function. Also, this function makes it possible to carry out IO
communication by InputOnly as well as message communication using
CIP. This manual describes the settings necessary for using this function
and its related information.
```
**1.1 System Configuration**

```
1.1.1 System Configuration Example
```
```
A system configuration example when using the EtherNet/IP (CPU board)
is as follows.
```
```
1.1.2 Adaptor
```
```
When the IO transmission/reception function is used, the DX200 can
operate as an adaptor (communication slave) for the scanner
(communication master). In the system configuration example, IO
communication is carried out with the external PLC being a scanner and
the DX200's EtherNet/IP (CPU board) being an adaptor.
```
```
1.1.3 Scanner
```
```
When the IO transmission/reception function is used, the DX200 can
operate as a scanner (communication master) for the adaptor
(communication slave). In the system configuration example, IO
communications is carried out with DX200's EtherNet/IP (CPU board)
being a scanner and the IO unit being an adaptor.

EtherNet/IP
Communication Function

```
1.1.4 Message Communication
```
```
Message communication can be carried out in parallel with IO
transmission and reception. In the system configuration example,
message communication with a PC is carried out. The DX200 Ethernet
function, the FTP function, and the EtherNet server function (the latter two
are extended functions) can be used for this message communication.
Also, communication using CIP is possible. To use the DX200 Ethernet
function and the extended option function, settings need to be made
separately.
```
```
1.1.5 IO Communication by InputOnly
```
```
When communication stations on the network communicate with one
another, in conventional ExlusiveOwner connection, as the number of
communication stations increases, the number of transmitted packets
increases sharply, placing considerable strain on the network band. To
cope with this problem, the multicast communication called InputOnly
connection is introduced to keep the increase in the number of packets
low.
```
```
1.1.6 Message Communication Using CIP
```
```
CIP for message communication is used so that communication with
general panel computer is possible.
```
```
NOTE When this system valid, PCU-ETHIO (EtherNet/IP board
made by Molex) is unavailable.

```
The above mentioned maximum transmission I/O points
(input: 4040 points/output: 4040 points) is a limitation by
EtherNet/IP communication specification. Because the
upper limit of the I/O points in the DX200 system is 4096
points when using this board with other board
simultaneously, the upper limit of the total of the I/O points
and the communication status used by this function or other
functions is also 4096 points. The communication status
occupies either 8 points or 16 points per network. For the
details, refer to the instructions of the I/O circuit board.
```
NOTE

Use this board within the above mentioned processing
capacity (3000 packets/sec). If it is used process beyond its
processing capacity, the alarm 100 “COMMUNICATION

```
A packet carrying the large data in the network might be caused by the
communication station performing a broadcast (a message or signal is
sent to all connected devices) or a multicast (one device communicates
with several devices with a single transmission). Perform the following
measures to reduce the packet numbers in the network.
```
```
(1) Limits the packet transmission route by Managed HUB
```
```
Install the Managed HUB instead of the Switching HUB, and set it
to send the packets to the necessary route. In addition, refer to a

```
```
For entry, use single-byte alphanumeric, dash “-”, underscore “_”, and dot
“.” characters.
```
```
 IP address setting (Host setting window)
In “IP ADDRESS SETTING”, specify the method for setting the IP address
for DX200.
```
```
Using the pull-down menu, select between “MANUAL SETTING” and

```
```
IP address
```
```
Using single-byte numeric characters and dots “.”, enter the IP address to
set to the DX200 in the format “xx.xx.xx.xx” (xx being a decimal number).
Note that when “DHCP SETTING” is selected in “IP ADDRESS
SETTING”, this setting will not be used.
```
NOTE The domain name is used when DNS is enabled.

NOTE

```
When “DHCP SETTING” is selected in “DNS SETTING” or
“SNTP SETTING”, “MANUAL SETTING” cannot be
selected in “IP ADDRESS SETTING” (if “MANUAL
SETTING” is selected, the error “DHCP is already set to use
for another item” occurs). To select “MANUAL SETTING” in

than “DHCP SETTING” in “DNS SETTING” and “SNTP
SETTING”.
```
NOTE

```
The DX200 does not support NetBIOS, WINS (Windows
Internet Name Service), or Dynamic DNS. For that reason,
if an IP address is arbitrarily set for the DX200 through
DHCP, access from outside becomes difficult. To make
access from outside easy even when an IP address is set
by DHCP, take measures on the DHCP server side as
needed such as always creating the same IP address as a
DHCP lease address.
```
NOTE

```
The DX200 supports IPv4 only.
```
```
IPv6 is not supported.

NOTE

```
For InputOnly communication, no output data exist. To carry
out InputOnly communication using the EtherNet/IP (CPU
board), set “0” for the output instance number.
```
```
Note that the instance number varies depending on the
communication device. For details on how to set the
instance number, see the instruction manual for the target

**4.4 Communication Data**

```
As IO data transferred into the DX200 from the EtherNet/IP (CPU board),
besides input/output data transmitted from external EtherNet/IP-supported
equipment, the status of the EtherNet/IP (CPU board) is also transferred.
```
```
Thus, in addition to the contact data area, an eight-point-worth (1 Byte)
area, for input and output each, for the status of the EtherNet/IP (CPU
board) is secured inside the DX200 (the output area cannot be used).
```
```
EtherNet/IP (CPU board) communication data are assigned to the
concurrent I/O signal external input/output signals.
```
```
Assignments to external input/output signals inside the EtherNet/IP (CPU
board) are made as follows:
```
```
(1) Number of bytes occupied by the DX200 as an IO module
Consists of the current value in item (2) below + status 1 byte. A
value displayed in section 4.2.7 “IO Module Re-configuration” is a
value obtained by converting this value into a bit count (x8).
```
```
(2) Number of bytes set for the EtherNet/IP (CPU board) I/O area
A value displayed as ‘IO size (IN/OUT)’ in section 4.2.3 “General
Setup for the EtherNet/IP (CPU board)”.
```
```
(3) Number of bytes set for the adaptor I/O area
A greater value between the values set for ‘Input size’/‘Output
size’ in section 4.2.5 “Adaptor Setting”.
```
```
(4) Number of bytes set for the scanner I/O area
This value cannot be set.

(5) Number of bytes set for the I/O areas (5), (5)', and (5)" of the
stations (devices) managed by scanner.
The number of bytes is to be set using ‘Input size’ or ‘Output size’
in section 4.2.2 “Setting the Device Information List”. Set which
device to use by making a choice from the registered device
information list in section 4.2.6 “Scanner Setting”.
```
```
The following chapter shows a concurrent I/O assignment example when
only the EtherNet/IP (CPU board) is installed. In the example,
communication is carried out assuming the quantity of data being 16 bytes
for adaptor, 8 bytes for station #1 of scanner, and 8 bytes for station #2 of
scanner (the same number of bytes for IN/OUT). And the 20010 - 20057
and 30010 - 30057 input/output areas are used by the DX200 standard I/O
unit.

**4.5 Communication Status**

```
To the one byte at the head of EtherNet/IP(CPU board) input data which is
allocated to an external input signal (20060 to 20067 in the above
mentioned example) indicates the communication status of EtherNet/IP
(CPU board).
```
```
 Alarming for communication error using a status
By using CIA ladder and universal alarms, an alarm can be generated
when EtherNet/IP(CPU board) detects a communication error.
```
```
Following is the example of above mentioned case.
```
```
Regard that following two alarms are generated.
```
- EtherNet/IP operation error
- EtherNet/IP communication error

```
For the registration of the universal alarms, refer to section 13.7 “I/O
Message and I/O Alarms” in the “DX200 OPTIONS INSTRUCTION FOR
CONCURRENT I/O”.
```
```
When the EtherNet/IP(CPU board) detects an error and it is reported by a
communication status error, a ladder program in which an alarm is
generated in accordance with an error signal is created.
```
```
Followings are the procedures for registering the above mentioned alarms
by universal alarms. Also, a ladder program which generates the error is
indicated.
```
```

NOTE

```
The ETHERNET/IP setting data “ETHERIP.DAT” is the
back-up data of the EtherNet/IP communication setting.
For the IO points used for the EtherNet/IP communication,
the data can be loaded only when the IO points set in the
“ETHERIP.DAT” file to be loaded and in the DX200 as the
load destination are the same.
```
```
Even if the total IO points are the same, when
“ETERRIP.DAT” is loaded while the contents of the IO data
allocation is different from the setting of the DX200, the
external IO allocation data must be updated.
Perform either of the following procedures to update.
```
- Load the external IO allocation data “EIOALLOC.DAT” for
    which the IO data is correctly allocated.
- Perform the reset ting of the external IO allocation under
    the maintenance mode.

Communication Function

**5.3 Related Parameters**

```
For CIP message communication, according to the function of the
communication target, set the following parameters:
```
```
Parameter No. Description Set Value Initial Value
RS022 Specify permission of Instance 0
```
```
Some equipment capable of CIP
message communication treats
instance 0 as a regular instance
number. To communicate with such
a device, set this parameter to “1”.
By setting this parameter to “1”, the
variable or register number as is can
be specified as an instance number.
(When this parameter is set to “0”,
specify the value by adding “1” to the
variable or the register number.)
```
### 10

```
RS023 Specify prohibition of 1 byte input/
output
```
```
Some equipment capable of CIP
message communication cannot
input or output one-byte data. To
communicate with such a device, set
this parameter to “1”.
By setting this parameter to “1”, data
whose size is originally one byte can
be transmitted/received as byte.
(Also in this case, only the one-byte
portion is treated as valid data.)
